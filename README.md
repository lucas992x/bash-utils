This repository contains some utilities written in Bash, specifically:
- `audio-from-video.sh` extracts audio track from a video directly, i.e. without conversion/compression. Requires [FFmpeg](http://ffmpeg.org/).
- `clone.sh` clones multiple repositories reading them from a text file.
- `git.sh` executes `git status` or `git pull` command in many repos at once.
- `print-path.sh` prints `PATH` one item per line.
- `remove-audio.sh` removes audio track from a video directly, i.e. without conversion/compression. Requires [FFmpeg](http://ffmpeg.org/).
